Workload Security helps you monitor user activity and detect potential security threats in your storage environment. Before you can begin monitoring, you need to configure agents, data collectors, and directory services to establish the foundation for comprehensive security monitoring. 

The Workload Security system uses an agent to collect access data from storage systems and user information from  Directory Services servers.
